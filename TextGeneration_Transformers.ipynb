            "Robotic process automation (RPA) is a software technology that automates the flow of information and information exchange between many different digital components via “bots.” In RPA, a bot is a software implementation of an intelligent robot, such as a robot that communicates with a human operator using an infrared (IR) wireless network, and is controlled not only via the human operator but also autonomously by a computer. For example, a bot may perform an action, such as an industrial robot that performs a welding operation, a robotic crane that makes and cuts a desired product, etc., autonomously by operating on a task that is provided by a human operator.\n",
